Lightweight Website Template
============================
The title says it all.

I found myself repeating a number of common steps in setting up simple webpages, and decided to built a template.

Out of the Box:
============================
CSS Reset, the Skeleton Responsive Grid, and jQuery.

Additionally, the header is set up with a vertically centered nav list on the right and title h1 on left.

Similarly, the footer has 3 nav lists organized in columns.

Also, I've given divs a border to aid in development/layout, because I like it like that.
